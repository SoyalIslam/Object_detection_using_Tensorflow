# 🎯 Object Detection Using TensorFlow 🚀

Welcome to the **Object Detection Using TensorFlow** project! This repo demonstrates real-time object detection using TensorFlow’s Object Detection API and a pre-trained **SSD MobileNet V2** model. Perfect for learning, experimentation, and even real-world applications! 🧠📸

---

## 💡 Features

✨ Real-time object detection using webcam
⚡️ GPU-accelerated with CUDA support
🎯 Pre-trained on the COCO dataset (90 common object categories)
🧰 Easy-to-use Python scripts
🧪 Compatible with Python 3.9 - 3.12

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

Make sure you have the following before running the project:

* ✅ Python 3.9 to 3.12
* ✅ NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
* ✅ Conda (recommended for managing environments)
* ✅ Webcam (for live object detection)

---

## 🔧 Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SoyalIslam/Object_detection_using_Tensorflow.git
cd Object_detection_using_Tensorflow
```

### 2️⃣ Set up a new Conda environment

```bash
conda create -n object_detection_env python=3.9 -y
conda activate object_detection_env
```

### 3️⃣ Install CUDA toolkit and cuDNN (for GPU support)

```bash
conda install cudatoolkit=11.2 cudnn=8.1 -c conda-forge
```

> 💡 You can adjust the versions of CUDA and cuDNN based on compatibility with your GPU and TensorFlow version.

### 4️⃣ Install project dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ How to Run

Simply launch the detection script:

```bash
python run.py
```

📷 This will activate your webcam and display real-time object detection with bounding boxes and class labels!

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

* 🧠 Make sure your GPU drivers are correctly installed and CUDA-compatible.
* ⚙️ For CPU usage, modify TensorFlow installation accordingly (GPU usage is recommended for real-time performance).
* 🎛️ Want to use a different camera or video? You can modify `camera.py` and `run.py` to suit your input.
